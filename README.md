### Features
+ Generates skydives for 4-way, 8-way and VFS categories, all drawn from the FAI IPC dive pools (which are used by most countries' skydiving authorities).
+ Automatic generation of all categories by substitution. Generates a AAA draw, then removes inappropriate formations, (and adds new to create correct points requirement), to derive AA.  Similarly for A and Rookie dives (and 8-way). Allows teams from lower categories to compare themselves against those above them.
+ Manual mode - you can type in your skydive, and it will generate the pictures for you.
+ Printing support (including print preview)!

### Installing:
DrawGen is written in Java, so needs the Java runtime environment installed. It's a free download from here: http://java.com/download. It will work equally well on Windows, Mac or Linux.
